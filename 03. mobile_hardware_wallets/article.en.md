### Mobile & Hardware Wallets

As an alternative to running a full PIVX Core Wallet, you can use either a mobile or a hardware wallet to manage your PIVs. This section contains tutorials for some of the mobile/hardware wallets members of the PIVX community use.

PIVX doesn't offer an official mobile wallet at the moment (the version available previously requires an upgrade to be compatible with the latest version of the PIVX protocol).

The PIVX downloads page ([https://pivx.org/downloads](https://pivx.org/downloads)) provides a list of hardware & mobile wallets that have been tested by the community.

! NOTE: Please make sure to do your own research/due diligence prior to trusting a third-party service with your keys to limit the risk of losing your coins!

This article is a good introduction on the different types of wallets and the risks/benefits associated: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-wallet.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-wallet.asp)
