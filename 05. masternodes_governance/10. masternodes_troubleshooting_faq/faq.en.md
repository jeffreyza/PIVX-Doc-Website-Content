    questions:
      - question: "Why is my masternode not becoming "Enabled?"  response: "Please make sure that both the online wallet and wallet holding the 10,000 PIV for staking are both running the latest software and updated to the latest block. Out-of-date software and forked blockchains are a common cause."
      - question: "I started my masternode, and it advanced through the queue to be next (or soon) to pay, yet it doesn't pay. Why?"
        response: "When a masternode first starts, it has to operate for a time to qualify for rewards. The qualifying time is approximately three days."
      - question: "I've received some masternode rewards and I want to spend them. How do I do it?"
        response: "You should move the rewards with care to avoid disrupting the masternode configuration. If you are committing 10,000 PIV using a Ledger hardware wallet, you can use the SPMT tool (made by PIVX developers) to claim the rewards."
